# MealTracker

## Summary

**Mealtracker** is a practical, fun, interactive way of documenting which general foodgroups(carbs, proteins, fruits, vegetables, drink, type of oils) your meal is composed of in a plate format and rendering it back to you on a calendar again in a plate format. 
This gives users knowledge of what foodgroups they consume most of and whether their plate aligns with the USDA recommended foodgroups percentage.
