Why this topic?
People usually measure their calorie intake and limit their calories on a daily basis, but surely not every meal is perfectly balanced per recommendations. With this users can document on a pie graph the approximate percent of food groups in an easy visual format and plan which categories they are eating more of or less of. 

Project MVP

Users of this web page can login and document the category(fruits, vegetables, protein, carbs) of food, what category of drink and what category of oil they consumed at each meal on a plate chart (plate visual). 
The plate will have set percentages of 40, 10, 25, 25. 
There will be an ideal plate that users can compare their progress to. 
Users can maintain a log of these plate visuals / day and view it on a calendar.

In a later version they can also answer the meal they ate and get the amount of calories they consumed.
In an even later version users can get the amount of calories that a user should eat based on some questions and get the amount of serving size per food group. Users can enter their mood before and after meals and get recommendations for next meal.
